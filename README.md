2)Then, mix up the wet ingredients starting with some unsalted butter and granulated sugar.
3)Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, you’ll beat in two eggs until well combined. 
4) Mix in the rest of the wet ingredients: some oil, red food coloring, vanilla extract, and distilled white vinegar.
7)After you’ve mixed up the wet ingredients, you’ll alternate mixing the dry ingredients in three additions with some buttermilk.
8)Once the cake batter is mixed up it will be a beautiful bright red color and now it is ready to bake!
Voila!and your cake is ready.
